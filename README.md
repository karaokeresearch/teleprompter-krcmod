## Teleprompter ##

Karaoke Research Council's modification of Peter Schmalfeldt's excellent HTML5/Javascript teleprompter.

You can edit the text right on the page. It'll even save your changes for you if you happen to leave the page.

If you're using an iPad, you can add a shortcut to your home screen for full screen awesomeness.

You can also use some handy keyboard shortcuts. You can adjust the speed & font size at the top right as well. I'm also experimenting with ways to flip the text around for you fancy folks using mirrors.

A new feature, requested by [Richard Di Brittannia](https://soundcloud.com/rdbritannia), allows you to change the colors of the text and background for situations where it might make things easier for you.  Changes are of course saved automatically.  ( Make sure you clear your browsers cache if you do not see these changes )

Finally, we also made an effort to make sure your text will be easy to read.   So if you are pasting text from a word document, we'll do some cleaning up to make the breaks flow more easily.
